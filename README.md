Modeling the Robot Arm:
Define the kinematics and dynamics of your 3-joint robot arm.
You can create a simplified model using joint-space motion blocks or more complex models with Simscape Multibody.
Consider using URDF files or creating your own robot model.
Controller Design:
Design a controller (e.g., PID, LQR) to control the robot’s joints.
Implement the controller in Simulink using blocks like PID Controller or Transfer Function.
Simulation:
Set up a simulation environment in Simulink.
Connect the robot model, controller, and any other components (e.g., sensors, actuators).
Run simulations to validate your design.
Visualization:
Use visualization tools to see the robot arm’s motion.
You can create 3D animations or plot joint trajectories.
Testing and Optimization:
Test different scenarios (e.g., pick-and-place tasks) to evaluate performance.
Optimize controller parameters for better accuracy and stability.
