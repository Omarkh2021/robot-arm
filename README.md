# robot-arm
Overview
This project simulates the motion and control of a 3-joint robotic arm using MATLAB and Simulink. The armâ€™s kinematics, dynamics, and controller design are modeled to achieve desired trajectories.

Contents
Modeling:
Describe how you modeled the robot arm (e.g., DH parameters, joint angles, link lengths).
Explain any assumptions made during modeling.
Controller Design:
Discuss the choice of controller (e.g., PID, LQR).
Provide details on controller tuning and gains.
Simulation Setup:
Explain how you set up the simulation environment in Simulink.
Include any additional components (sensors, actuators).
Results and Visualization:
Present simulation results (joint angles, end-effector position).
Include 3D animations or plots.
Usage:
Instructions for running the simulation.
Any additional notes or considerations.
Dependencies
MATLAB
Simulink
(Any other relevant libraries or toolboxes)
How to Run
Clone this repository.
Open the Simulink model.
Configure simulation parameters.
Run the simulation.
